## Question

What if we had the sort of toolchain for C that we have for Rust?

## Another Question

What if you didn't have to deal with autotools and m4 when building stuff from source?

## ANOTHER

What if you didn't have to write if/else statements in build scripts to check if
you're using msvc or clang or apple clang or gcc?

---

## Zig

It's cool.

## If you don't like the language

Don't worry about it.
